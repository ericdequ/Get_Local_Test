                <p>The GET app was created with the intention of providing a specific, yet needed service to clients in fields of computer science and similar.
                    The app contains an extensive database of CS terms and acronyms for the user to search and learn about, with informative definitions and links to additional sites provided.
                    Should the term or acronym not exist within the database, the user can request a term for our dedicated administration team to add to it.
